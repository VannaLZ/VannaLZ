## <div align="center"> I am currently working on the ["Vinyl_Collection_Project"](https://github.com/VannaLZ/Vinyl_Collection_Project)
  
### Introduction
<div align="justify">I'm on the road to data exploration, and while I'm still gathering info, I've already started to rock some formulas and do a little <b>'Bohemian Rhapsody'</b> with some exploratory data analysis (EDA). It's early days, and my README isn't quite <b>'Under Pressure'</b> yet, but I'm jamming on this project like <b>'Another One Bites the Dust'</b>.</div>
  


### Goals
<div align="justify">One idea I have is to create a Tableau page that's as visually stunning as <b>'Radio Ga Ga'</b>, but I know that the journey ahead is full of challenges that I'm ready to face like a true champion with <b>'We Will Rock You'</b> spirit.</div>

### Conclusion
<div align="justify"><b>'The Show Must Go On'</b>, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!</div>
